🇪🇹 Ethiopian E-Commerce Web Application (Frontend)

I built a modern Ethiopian e-commerce web application using React, Tailwind CSS, and Redux with a strong focus on performance, usability, and responsive design.

Key Features:

🛒 Product listing with categories

🔍 Search and filter functionality

🧾 Product detail pages

🛍️ Shopping cart using Redux for global state management

📱 Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

🎨 Clean and modern UI built with Tailwind CSS

Technologies Used:

React – Component-based UI development

Redux – State management (cart, products, UI state)

Tailwind CSS – Fast, responsive, and modern styling

This project demonstrates my ability to build real-world e-commerce interfaces, manage application state efficiently, and create user-friendly experiences tailored for local Ethiopian businesses.
